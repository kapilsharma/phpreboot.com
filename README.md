# PHPReboot.com website

This repository contains code of `PHPReboot.com` website.

## Why open source?

Wondering why we made whole website open-source. Isn't it a security concern?

Well, we think otherwise. PHP Reboot is a developers community and we are committed to spread knowledge among developers. The major goal of keeping website open source is to provide an example of how big project works, their workflow, code quality, and planning.

Any developer may join and contribute in the development of phpreboot.com. As a reward, you will get a chance to call yourself as open source contributor, and learn how to manage big projects. Also, when you send your PR, we will review your code, and if not accepted, we will explain why it can't be accepted. This way, you will again learn how to code.

As far as security is concerned, we take it as challenge. Whole source code is available, hack the website :)

If hacked, although very difficult, we will know the vulnerabilities and fix the issue. Still, we will be learning in the process. After all, php reboot is dedicated for learning.

Once the site is ready and live, it will obviously contains many things, that developers want to share and keep track of.
